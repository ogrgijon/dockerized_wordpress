SIMPLE Wordpress Fast Develop Enviroment with Docker

I was searching for this, and everybody makes very complex docker-compose files, 
this is very simple.

1- If you has already a working Docker System in your machine, only need copy all of this git structure and files to your project root folder.

2- Change with [search and replace] in the file /nginx/default.conf example.com to your hostname and all is set.

3- The docker, will build two empty folders (Themes and Plugins), put inside your basetheme or the baseplugins, and you can now starts coding.

(MIND THE GAP) If you are a new developer, remind that's you will need to redir the hostname to 127.0.0.1 (Or localhost) in your local machine, using for example Host File Editor (Free Software)

I'm wait that this can help you. 

Happy Coding!
